Title: Future Improvements

Ideas
- Replace ListenConsole with non-blocking or optional console handling for service mode.
- Consider authenticated stream cipher for peer streams (e.g., AES/GCM in segments or ChaCha20-Poly1305).
- Expand E2E to verify peering and simple message exchanges with controlled seeds.

Verification
- Tracked as follow-ups; not yet implemented. Presence of this document is validated by a test to ensure the roadmap is recorded.
